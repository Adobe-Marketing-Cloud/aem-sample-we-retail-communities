Here are a few of my best tips for women (or indeed anyone) when hitting the slopes or trails.",skigirl.jpg,we-retail:activity/skiing,"Cross-country skiing: Warming up. Don't discount the value of a proper warm-up. If you step out in to the cold and immediately start to exert yourself too much, you are much more likely to get injured. A quick warmup and stretch can work wonders!",Dress for the weather. But not too warmly. Remember that you need to dress warmly enough to be comfortable but not so warmly that you overheat. The best strategy is to layer your clothes so you can adjust them as needed. Alpine skiers should be especially aware of this since while sitting in the chairlift you need to keep warm but when skiing down the piste may not need so much insulation.,Keep hydrated. The main mistake many people make during winter sports is to think that in the cold you don't need as much water. Nothing could be further from the truth. The best solution is to bring a long small thermos of sweetened tea. This is especially important for cross-country skiers.,"Rewards.

And the answer is three simple words: ""layering, layering, layering!""",layeriton.jpg,we-retail:activity/skiing,Layering helps you stay warm and comfortable in a number of ways:,It traps insulating air between the layers,"It wicks away moisture from your skin, keeping you dry. And keeping dry is an important part of keeping warm.","Compared to one thick layer, multiple thiner layers let you adapt to circumstances by removing or opening an out layer when you get too hot.",In most cases three layers are optimal:,A base layer next to your skin that draws away perspiration. The most common materials for this layer are wool or synthetics like polyesther or microfibre fabrics. At We.Retail we recommend long underwear made from Merino wool. It has excellent wicking ability combined with a natural softness that won't irritate your skin like other wools sometimes do. It is also naturally resistant to odours.,"An insulating layer. This should be made of a breatable insulation like a wool, fleece or down jacket. Depending on the situation we recommend either fleece or down. Fleece provides good insulation and absorbs very little moisture. Down on the other hand provides even better insultaion but is more absorabnt of water. For moderate cold fleece is sufficient, but in very cold dry conditions a down jacket with a thinner fleece layer underneath is the best.","A shell. The shell should be waterproof or at least water-resistant but breatable. We recommend Nortex material. It is waterproof but has micropores that allows water vapour out. In less extreme settings, a breathable polyesther shell can also be used, but these are water-resistant, not truly waterproof. Plastic raincoats and the like should be avoided. They trap moisture in your clothes and next to your skin and before long you are soaking wet and cold.",Short of Layers? We.Retail-Outdoors has options for every need.

emily.andrews@mailinator.com,0,Aloha spirits in Northern Norway,"Steep mountain sides surround us, like wise trolls from a distant timeline, weathered and worn by long-gone glaciers, green moss now covering the black rock. White sheep forage on steep grass, defying the chilling winds funneled by the deep valley. The subtle hues of the arctic circle are welcoming, comfortable on the eyes. When rare sunrays pierce through the low clouds, the scenery reveals its vibrancy, as the waves reflect a translucent cyan blue before crashing loudly onto white sand. A small but playful groundswell is building, the offshore breeze grooming playful lines down the point, making for welcoming conditions for acclimatizing to cold water and thick neoprene. Knowing it is our last surf before a few days of hard wind, we take full advantage out of every ripple the North Atlantic Ocean sends our way. Tomorrow this place will have taken on a very different, much more hostile appearance.",,we-retail:activity/hiking,isDraft,"The front is due to arrive any hour now, weather charts calling for anything in between regular bad weather and full arctic storm. In our fishing cabin in the quaint fiord, weather and surf forecast websites are refreshed hourly, for any update or hint on where to find the most manageable conditions. Wetsuits dried and ready, fresh wax coat on the surfboards. Tents are inspected, every seam scrutinized. To properly score in this part of the world, equipment means everything, and any inconsistency can ruin a session, the whole trip even. As our social media devices are put on sleep mode and reading lamps are switched off, the wind grows in intensity, rattling our windows through the night. Every surfer knows the feeling of combined anxiety and excitement, the questions that linger in our minds while falling asleep before a swell. Tomorrow they will be answered; we tell each other before updating the charts just one last time.","The morning after the winds have subsided, and when arriving at a secret coastline we have been given directions to, we are greeted by clean waves, improving with the incoming tide. A few cars parked in the grassy field outside the quiet farm village, and local surfers getting changed are signs that in 2015, no surf spots are kept away from satellite photos and internet forums. Still, there are enough of waves to keep us all warm in the frigid line-up. The media crew on the beach is doing their best to keep dry. The rain keeps hammering down; to a point where little freshwater streams start flooding the field, and cameras start breaking down. If finding good surf this far north in October is a daunting task, documenting it is proving even more difficult. It's easy to mistake the athletes in the water for the tough ones; stripping naked in near freezing temps and paddling out into the North Atlantic Ocean to get their fix of far-traveled energy. Instead, the real heroes are often the ones on the beach, stumbling on slippery rocks, wearing layers upon layers of technical clothing, cameras in plastic bags, fighting the elements to get the shot, all to make the trip ""worth it"". Even if the true reward is in the waves surfed, without documentations they are just memories, and in a time where success is measured in thumbs-up icons and visitor stats, the golden memories of the moments you shared in the water are no longer enough, for better or for worse.","A window of blue afternoon sky is getting nearer, and from experience we know that it might be only a matter of minutes before the rain starts again. In only a week, late summer has turned into autumn, the rain crystallizing above us, capping the black mountains with a fine layer of white snow. In front of the picturesque lineup we pitch our tents on wet grass, sheltered by the cliff wall on one side and some old fishing sheds. Neoprene is hung to dry after hours in the water, not that it won't still be wet the following morning, but any attempts to make surfing in the Arctic easier count. As dark falls, we make another pot of pesto tortellini and prepare for the night, to the sound of polished rocks rumbling in the shore break below our tents.","Like a faint torch, a striking green hue shines through the tent fabric, disappearing just as quickly. The sound of zippers does its best to penetrate the ocean's roar, as we curiously peek our heads out into the freezing wind. Moments after, we sprint out in sweatpants, cameras in hand to document the fabled phenomenon the past week's cloud layer has prevented us from seeing; the Aurora Borealis. It starts with only the faintest streaks of green and blue, seemingly appearing out of thin air, only to vanish before our eyes have had a chance to adjust to the dark. Every pulse becoming more radiant, and before we know it we are gazing in awe at the dancing curtains, shifting colors under starry skies. After a week of battling the elements, it's as if Mother Nature has decided to treat us with just a taste of the breathtaking beauty she is capable of, as if we have finally proven ourselves worthy. With our jaws still open, we watch on as the mesmerizing curtains of emerald green are veiled in a dark cloud layer, and the winds once again take hold of the bay. The exhibition is over for now, but these islands will stay in our minds forever. See you next time, Lofoten, may the forces of life yet again gravitate us towards your majestic shores, because in the hardship of finding what we came for, something else has emerged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The twist and lock poles are kind of an outdated technology as far as poles are concerned. The threads inside the locking mechanism are just asking to get worn out or stripped every time you make an adjustment. It's a catch 22. If you don't tighten the poles tight enough, they don't stay at the height they are supposed to. If you tighten the poles too tight, every time you do the threads will become less effective.

If you are out there looking for snorkeling fins, you won't find much in the silicone free department. However, if you look around for SCUBA fins, you will find a pretty decent selection. The SCUBA fins will offer a heel strap that clicks to tighten, and is made entirely of plastic. The only drawback: you will need to wear neoprene dive boots. They are quite comfy and keep your feet warm, but it is another expense.",iStock_000017623596Small.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

felicia.carter@trashymail.com,1,Reply,"Josh, thanks for the reply. I will definitely look into getting SCUBA fins. I've already accepted the fact that I will have to pay extra on a few things here and there because of my allergy, and this option doesn't sound unreasonable at all. I'm wondering if I can just buy the booties and wear them with silicone snorkeling fins since my skin wouldn't come in contact with the fins at all. Maybe that would save me some money_..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"Felicia, unfortunately that will not work. Snorkeling fins are generally too narrow around the ball of your foot to allow for a bootie. It would be pretty uncomfortable if it were even possible, in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"If you don't want to spend the extra money for gloves with a warmer pouch, I would suggest taking a pair of one-size-fits-all-liners (if you don't already have some, they cost $2 just about anywhere) and wearing them under your gloves. This way, you can slide the hand warmer between the gloves and not risk irritating your hands. The only drawback is, of course, if you need to grip anything like ski poles the warmers will get in the way. Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"The Lagos is an all-epoxy, super light board. That's a good question that I think a lot of people overlook when shopping around for their first board, so good looking out. In addition to the Lagos being a lot lighter than a glass board, it is also way stronger which is an important consideration if you plan on being bad for a while (kidding). Overall, I recommend epoxy. It's more buoyant and if you are one to care about the environment, epoxy decomposes a lot faster than traditional glass. My friend has a GoPro and got this awesome picture of me on my board (it's epoxy).",iStock_000008387990Small_edit.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
